## Catapult Codesign

Use the Python environment that gets created with Catapult AI NN. See also these [instructions](https://github.com/GiuseppeDiGuglielmo/catapult_venvs) to properly setup the Catapult environment. The `ccs_venv` environment may be missing some additional packages to properly run the notebooks in this repository. Please `pip install` what is missing for now, while I will follow up with more instructions in the future.

Remember to export Catapult HLS paths and variables so the `MGC_HOME` variable is defined.

Run Jupyter Lab:
```
make jupyter-lab
```
